### **Linux Kernel**

1. **Definition**:

   - Core component of the Linux OS; bridges hardware and software.

2. **Responsibilities**:

   - **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and device I/O.
   - **Process Management**: Handles scheduling and multitasking.
   - **Memory Management**: Allocates system memory.
   - **Device Drivers**: Interfaces with hardware.

3. **Types**:

   - **Monolithic Kernel**: All essential services in one block (e.g., Linux).
   - **Microkernel**: Minimal core; most services run in user space.

4. **Kernel Modules**:

   - Loadable components for added flexibility (e.g., device drivers).

5. **System Calls**:

   - Interface for applications to request kernel services.

6. **Development**:

   - Community-driven with regular updates and patches.

7. **Versions**:

   - Follows major.minor.patch format (e.g., 5.14.0).

8. **Boot Process**:

   - Loaded at startup; initializes hardware and system processes.

9. **Security**:
   - Implements security models like SELinux and AppArmor.
